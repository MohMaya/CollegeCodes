# Vernam Cipher

The Vernam Cipher is based on the principle that each plaintext character from a message is 'mixed' with one character from a key stream. If a truely random key stream is used, the result will be a truely 'random' ciphertext which bears no relation to the original plaintext. In that case the cipher is similar to the unbreakable One-Time Pad (OTP). As it was generally used with teleprinters and 5-level punched tape, the system is also known as One-Time Tape or OTT. 

The ciphertext is generated by applying the logical XOR operation to the individual bits of plaintext and the key stream. The advantage of using the XOR operation for this, is that it can be undone by carrying out the same operation again. In other words: 

`plaintext + key = ciphertext â‡’ ciphertext + key = plaintext`

In mathematics, the XOR operation is known as modulo-2 addition. In our case, the individual bits of the plaintext are XOR-ed with the individual bits of the key. The resulting bit will only be '1' if the two input bits are different. If they are equal (both 1 or both 0), the result will be '0'.

Take the letter 'A', which is represented by 00011, and add it to the letter 'B', represented by 11001. A bit-wise XOR operation yields 11010 which, in the ITA2 table, is the letter 'G'. In fact, each bit from the key tells us whether or not the corresponding bit from the plaintext should be inverted. By inverting these key-bits again, as shown above, the original character is revealed.
